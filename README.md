This project is a rule engine designed to help you create and manage rules with triggers and procedures to execute. It is built using the .NET framework and provides a flexible and customizable solution for managing rules in your applications and workflows.

The project provides a wide range of features to help you create and manage rules effectively. For example, you can define trigger conditions using a simple and intuitive syntax, such as specifying a specific date and time or setting up a recurring schedule. You can also specify the procedures that should be executed when the rule is triggered, such as sending a command, activate a trigger variable, etc.

One of the key features of this rule engine project is its flexibility. You can create simple rules with a single trigger and procedure, or complex rule sets that involve multiple triggers and procedures. The project provides a range of tools to help you manage these rules effectively, such as the ability to group rules by category or to set up alerts to notify you when a rule has been triggered.

This project is also highly customizable. You can easily modify the code to add new features or functionality or to customize the behavior of existing features.
